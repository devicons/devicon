            Hi!

            I'm Devicons' Peek Bot and I just peeked at the icons that you wanted to add using [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select).
            Here is the result below:

            ![Peeked Icons (top left)]({0})

            Here are the zoomed-in screenshots of the added icons:
            {1}

            Note: If the images doesn't show up, it's probably because it has been autodeleted by Imgur after 6 months due to our API choice.

            The maintainers will now take a look at it and decide whether to merge your PR.

            Cheers :),
