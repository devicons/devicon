      #       Hi! I'm Devicons' GitHub Actions Bot!
            
      #       I just peeked at the icons that you wanted to add and upload them to the 
      #       [Actions page](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/actions). The maintainers
      #       will now take a look at it and decide whether to merge your PR.

      #       Cheers :),
