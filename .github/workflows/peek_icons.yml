            Hi! I'm Devicons' Peek Bot!
            
            I just peeked at the icons that you wanted to add using [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select).

            Here is the result below:

            ![Peeked Icons (top left)]({0})

            Note: If the image doesn't show up, it's probably because it has been autodeleted by Imgur after 6 months due to our API choice.

            Here is [the url]({1}). 
            

            The maintainers will now take a look at it and decide whether to merge your PR.

            Cheers :),
