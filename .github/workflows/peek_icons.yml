            Hi!

            I'm Devicons' Peek Bot and it seems we've ran into a problem. I'm supposed to check your svgs but I couldn't do my task due to an issue.

            Can you please double check and fix the possible issues below:

            - Your svgs are named and added correctly to the /icons folder as seen [here](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#orgGuidelines).
            - Your icon information has been added to the `devicon.json` as seen [here](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updateDevicon)
            - Your PR title follows the format seen [here](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#overview)

            Once everything is fixed, the maintainers will try again. If I still fail, the maintainers will investigate what cause this problem. 

            Thank you for your help :smile:

            Cheers :),
