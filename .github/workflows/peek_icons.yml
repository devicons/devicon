            ~Hi

            I'm Devicons' Peek Bot and it seems we've ran into a problem (sorry!).

            Please double check and fix the possible issues below:

            - Your svgs are named and added correctly to the /icons folder as seen [here](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#orgGuidelines).
            - Your icon information has been added to the `devicon.json` as seen [here](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updateDevicon)
            - Your PR title follows the format seen [here](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#overview)

            Once everything is fixed, I will try. If I still fail (sorry!), the maintainers will investigate further. 

            Best of luck, 
            Peek Bot :relaxed:
