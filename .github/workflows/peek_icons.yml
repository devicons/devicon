            Hi! I'm Devicons' GitHub Actions Bot!
            
            I just peeked at the icons that you wanted to add and upload them to the 
            [Actions page](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/actions). The maintainers
            will now take a look at it and decide whether to merge your PR.

            Cheers :),
            Bot
