            Hi there,

            I'm Devicons' Peek Bot and I just peeked at the icons that you wanted to add using [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select).
            Here is the result below:

            ![Peeked Icons (top left)]({0})

            Here are the zoomed-in screenshots of the added icons:
            {1}

            Note: If the images don't show up, it's probably because it has been autodeleted by Imgur after 6 months due to our API choice.

            **The maintainers will now take a look at it and decide whether to merge your PR.**

            Thank you for contributing to Devicon! I hope everything works out and your icons are accepted into the repo.

            Cheers, 
            Peek Bot :blush:

            Hi there,

            I'm Devicons' Peek Bot and it seems we've ran into a problem (sorry!).

            Please double check and fix the possible issues below:

            - Your svgs are named and added correctly to the /icons folder as seen [here](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#orgGuidelines).
            - Your icon information has been added to the `devicon.json` as seen [here](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updateDevicon)
            - Your PR title follows the format seen [here](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#overview)

            Once everything is fixed, I will try. If I still fail (sorry!), the maintainers will investigate further. 

            Best of luck, 
            Peek Bot :relaxed:
