            Hi!

            I'm Devicons' SVG-Checker Bot and it seems we have some issues with your SVGs.

            Here is what went wrong:
            ```
            {0}
            ```

            For more reference on why these are errors, check out our [CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#svgStandards)

            Please address these issues. When you update this PR, I will check your SVGs again.

            Thanks for your help,
            SVG-Checker Bot :smile:
              
            PS. One day, I will be smart enough to fix these errors for you :persevere:. Until then, I can only point them out.

            Hi!

            I'm Devicons' SVG-Checker Bot and it seems we've ran into a problem. I'm supposed to check your svgs but I couldn't do my task due to an issue.

            Please let my maintainers know of the issues. They will take a look at my work and try to resolve the problem. Until then, please hang tight and sorry for the inconvenience.

            Cheers,
            SVG-Checker Bot :smile:
