            Hello,

            I'm Devicon's Build Bot and I just built some new font files and devicon.min.css file.

            The devicon.min.css file contains:
            -The icon content
            -The aliases
            -The colored classes

            I also compiled a list of new features and icons that were added since last release.
            ```
            {0}
            ```

            More information can be found in the GitHub Action logs for this workflow.

            Adios,
